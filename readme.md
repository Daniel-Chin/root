My personal Windows tools. It's in my `%path%`. You don't need to care about this. 

This repo exists so that my tools are synced across many mahcines.  
This way, I can enjoy a personalized command line environment whereever I go, or when I get a new computer ([that hasn't happend yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotheticals)).
